# Astro Crusade is an 8-bit game inspired by the classic space invaders game and is developed in pico-8 using LUA as the programming language. I hope you enjoy the game!

to boot the game:
- Extract the folder from the zip file
- Keep the JS and HTML files in the same directory
- Double click the HTML file, it will open a page on your main browser
- Hit the play button and start playing!

controls:
- up key: move up
- down key: move down
- left key: move left
- right key: move right
- X: precision shot
- C: cherry bomb

tip: cherry bomb is dictated by how many cherries you collect and is indicated
on the top right corner of your screen. If you collect 5 cherries you will
automatically gain an additional heart in your missing HP. If you press
C it will shoot a spread shot with 2X times the amount of cherries you used 
to activate it
